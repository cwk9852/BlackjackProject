## Blackjack Project

### Skill Distillery Week 4 Homework

### Description
BlackJackTable is a simple command line version of the well-known game of 21. There is only one rule, if the house can hit, the house must hit. The house can hit if the house hand value is less than 17. The game is over if any hand is meaningfully equal to, or greater than 21 (WIN). The game is also over if all hands are equal and the house can not hit (PUSH). The winner is the player with 21, or player with the highest hand value less than 21.

Note:
This implementation doesnt let the player hit if there is a PUSH. Its a freebie.

## Lessons Learned
A lot of practice on calling/writing methods, extends and implements, experimented with constants, implementing enums. Observed that just getting in the reps of writing the code has made me less worried about "feeling ready" to write code, and just tried writing it. Went down about four "rabbit holes" because due to errors with APIE considerations. Need to first "think about it in english" instead of going straight to code. Substantial time spent on variables. Simply calling the method would have saved a lot of time. Substantial time spent on stretch goal methods for insurance, bets, and pays, that did not end up in the final table as they were not working. 

Areas to Improve: 
"working" before "refactoring"
APIE
Develop (Writes Tests)
Develop (Draws UML) 
Develop (Workflow)

### Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, vi, git
